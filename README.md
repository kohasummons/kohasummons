Heyy Heyy! My name is Joshua (friends call me koha â€” you can too ðŸ˜‰) and I am a Software Engineer with a strong background in design. I am always advocating for Open Source, Community, slick and super accessible designs and recently, the blockchain. I love explaining stuff in simple and understandable bit. That's has led me to technical writing.

My interests cut across many parallels and domains. And sometimes, you might catch me musing over topics like XR, neurotech, startups, Cyber Fiction and genre bending musics.

I [write](https://koha.hashnode.dev). I make [videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7-Zub9gIa3iZby6stMY-Ww). I foster [communities](https://#)(coming). Whatever really to share what I have been learning and give someone out there an easier start. Oh, and sometimes those things could be turn out to be:

- poetry, music and speaking
- planning whatever spark of idea i've got - [OuterSpace]()
- bingewatching stuff!
- investing in early-stage startup (putting this here for my future self, haha)
- talking someone into open source contribution
