Heyy Heyy! My name is Joshua (fellas out here call me koha — you can too) and I am a Nigerian Software Engineer who likes to breathe into ideas and wake 'em up. I am always tooting my horns about Open Source, Community, Good bangin' and accessible designs and the blockchain.

My interests cut across many parallels and domains. And sometimes, you might catch me musing over topics like XR, neurotech, startups, Cyber Fiction and genre bending musics.

I [write](https://koha.hashnode.dev). I make [videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7-Zub9gIa3iZby6stMY-Ww). I foster [communities](https://#)(coming). Whatever really to share what I have been learning and give someone out there an easier start. Oh, and sometimes those things could be turn out to be:

- poetry
- planning whatever spark of idea i've got - [OuterSpace]()
- bingewatching stuff!
- investing in early-stage startup (putting this here for my future self, haha)
- talking someone into open source contribution
