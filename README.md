# 🐑 Supreme Leader, If I may

I, *Koha* of the Motherboard, raise my glass to welcome you.

On glorious days, you would find me submitting unsolicited pull requests to intresting projects, or not. Compiling my ~brain farts~ thoughts, ideas, and musings on a blog which, at the moment is being a very nice host to dusts and other crawling things.

My desire is to conquer the world and raise an army of cyborgs who I can bend to my will. Mostly to do my laundry. hahahahh.

Though they come at me with 
- Light sabers with the power button missing ⚔️ 
- Kanye's - Heaven and Hell soundtrack🗡️
- A tad bit over over Expensive course 📚

I'm learning to wield the greatest weapon of all: *JavaScript*. And perhaps, just possibly *figma*. And you know what, include *mongoDb*. Okay, Last one, I promise, *Solidity*.
