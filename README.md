## Hi! I'm koha. 

I am a product designer, software engineer and blockchain sorcerer

Two things I am crazily in love with - computational art and opensource.


- 🌍 I stay up all night fiddling with figma to make products usable, accessible and bangin'
- :fire: I'm obsessed about generative arts
- 🌱 Learning more and studying about Ethereum, XR, web3, Open Source.
- 💬 Ping me about Product Design, vue, Open source, web3, Technical Writing.

Currently seeking out my next oppourtunity, If you want to have a discuss, say hi sometimes -->





Heyy! 

I'm koha. or Josh. Whichever. I am a fan of: the rituals of subculture, curation, creative destruction and code.
I argue kanye has made my most favourite tracks till date. Vue and Figma are my deliquiencies. and more recently solidity.

Projects: [Wall of Dreams](wallofdreams.netlify.com), Waveritium
<br/>

I'm on the lookout for roles that swoons on my ability to learn new sturvs, superfast! Advocacy might be a suitable name. or whatever you have in mind. 
*phew. That's all. For now at least. Catch you sometimes in the wild. or you could reach out on twitter @kohasummons. do you! :zap:


<br/>
May the lights of opensource guide your way to... 
*insert your valhalla*
