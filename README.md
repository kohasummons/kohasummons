## 🐑 Supreme Leader, If I may.

I, *Koha* of the Motherboard, raises my glass to welcome you to my github profile. 

On glorious days, you would find me submitting unsolicited pull requests to projects who have not sought my help. Compiling my ~brain farts~ thoughts, ideas, and musings on a blog which, at the moment is being a very nice host to dusts and cobwebs.

My desire is to conquer the world and raise an army of cyborgs who I can bend to my will. Mostly to do my laundry. hahahahh.

Though they come at me with 
- swords⚔️ 
- daggers🗡️
- Kalashnikov 🔫
- M16's 🏹
- Expensive courses 📚

I wield the greatest weapon of all: *JavaScript*. And *figma*. And *mongoDb*. And *Solidity*
