Heyy Heyy! My name is Joshua (friends call me koha — you can too 😉) and I am a Software Engineer with a strong background in design. I am always advocating for Open Source, Community, sweet and accessible designs and recently, the blockchain. I love explaining stuff in simple and understandable bit. That's has led me to technical writing & Content Creation.

My interests cut across many parallels and domains. And sometimes, you might catch me musing over topics like XR, neurotech, startups, Cyber Fiction and genre bending musics.

I [write](https://koha.hashnode.dev). I make [videos](https://www.youtube.com/@kohawithstuff). I foster [communities](https://dub.sh/abyteofkoha). Whatever really to share what I have been learning and give someone out there an easier start. Oh, and sometimes those things could be turn out to be:

- architecting developer communities 
- poetry, music and speaking
- shipping whatever spark of idea i've got - [NothingFactory](https://github.com/nothingfactory) \\ [Daccred](https://github.com/daccred)
- investing in early-stage startup (putting this here for my future self, haha)
- talking someone into an open source contribution
